## Artificial Intelligence Integration
RecipeMaker incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance user experience and recipe quality. AI algorithms analyze recipes submitted by users, checking for accuracy, completeness, and potential issues.

Additionally, the project has a reporting system where the AI system assists moderators by analyzing recipes, that users wish to publish, for suspicious content.

The moderator's role is to review recipes that have been flagged by users and analyzed by the AI system for suspicious content. Based on their review, the moderator will make a decision to either approve or reject the recipe for the publication.
